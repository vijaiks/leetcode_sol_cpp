1. checkInclusionOfPermutationOfStr

/------------------------------------

Given two strings s1 and s2, write a function to return true if s2 contains the permutation of s1. In other words, one of the first string's permutations is the substring of the second string.
Input: s1 = "ab" s2 = "eidbaooo"
Output: True

2. findAnagram

/------------------------------------

Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all the start indices of p's anagrams in s.
Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings s and p will not be larger than 20,100.
The order of output does not matter 
Input:
s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"
Output: [0, 6]  
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".

3. groupAnagrams

/------------------------------------

Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.
Example:

Input: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"],

Output:
[
  ["ate","eat","tea"],
  ["nat","tan"],
  ["bat"]
]
